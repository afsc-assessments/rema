</h2>
<p>The base REMA model is best-represented as a simple state-space random walk model with added noise. The observation model is comprised of an index of log-transformed annual survey biomass (<span class="math inline">\(ln(B_t)\)</span>) estimates with associated standard deviations (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{ln(B_t)}\)</span>), where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{ln(B_t)}\)</span> is approximated using the coefficient of variation of <span class="math inline">\(B_t\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{B_t}/B_t\)</span>) such that <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{ln(B_t)}=\sqrt{ln(\frac{\sigma_{B_t}}{B_t}^2+1)}
\]</span> The measurement or observation equation, which describes the relationship between the observed survey biomass <span class="math inline">\(ln(B_t)\)</span> and the latent state variable, the population biomass (<span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{B}_t)\)</span>). The measurement equation is expressed as <span class="math display">\[
ln(B_t) = ln(\hat{B}_t) + \epsilon_{B}, \text{where } \epsilon_{B} \sim N(0, \sigma_{ln(B_t)}^2), 
\]</span> while the state equation and associated process error variance (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{PE}^2\)</span>) is defined as <span class="math display">\[
ln(\hat{B}_{t+1}) = ln(\hat{B}_t)+\eta_t, \text{where } \eta_t \sim N(0, \sigma_{PE}^2). 
\]</span> In the base model, the process error variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{PE}^2\)</span> is the only fixed effect parameter estimated, and the unobserved population biomass <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{B}_t)\)</span> is estimated as a series of random effects. The model specified above is fit using maximum likelihood estimation, where random effects are integrated from the joint likelihood via the Laplace Approximation in TMB or ADMB.</p>

</h3>
<p>The single survey, single stratum version of the model can be extended to include one or more additional strata (<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>) from the same survey. The inclusion of multiple strata in the same model is advantageous in scenarios where the apportionment of biomass among areas is a desired result. This extension assumes no correlation in the observation errors among survey strata, though PE variance can be shared or estimated independently among strata. An example of using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to explore the inclusion of strata-specific PE variances versus a single, shared PE is outlined in example 2 of <strong>Appendix A</strong>.</p>
<p>The ADMB and TMB versions of REMA utilize different methods for estimating variance of the total predicted biomass. Therefore, while strata-specific estimates of predicted biomass and associated confidence intervals will be identical between the ADMB and TMB versions of the model, the confidence intervals of the total predicted biomass will differ slightly. In the original ADMB code, the Marlow (1967) method is applied, such that the total variance (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_J^2\)</span>) is approximated as <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_J^2 = ln(\frac{\sum{e^{2 \hat{B}_j + \sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2} (e^{\sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2 - 1})}} {(\sum{e^{\hat{B}_j + \sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2/2}})^2} + 1).
\]</span> In the updated REMA library, the total variance is estimated using the standard Delta method and can be replicated in ADMB using an <code>sdreport_number</code> and in TMB using the <code>ADREPORT</code> macro. As described in Monnahan et al. (2021), the exploration of methods for summing lognormal variables is an area ripe for research that has potential impacts far beyond the scope of REMA. A subset of the authors here have a study in prep on this topic and will provide an update to the Joint Groundfish Plan Teams at a later time.</p>

</h3>
<p>In situations where an auxillary biomass or catch per unit effort (CPUE) survey (<span class="math inline">\(I_{t,j}\)</span>) and associated variance (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{I_{t,j}}\)</span>) are available, an additional scaling parameter <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> can be estimated to facilitate the inclusion of this new information into biomass predictions. The predicted annual CPUE survey index by strata <span class="math inline">\(\hat{I}_{t,j}\)</span> is calculated as <span class="math display">\[
\hat{I}_{t,j} = q_j * e^{\hat{B}_{t,j}}
\]</span> and the CPUE survey observations has an additional measurement equation and likelihood component similar to the biomass survey: <span class="math display">\[
ln(I_{t,j}) = ln(\hat{I}_{t,j}) + \epsilon_{I}, \text{where } \epsilon_{I} \sim N(0, \sigma_{ln(I_t)}^2), 
\]</span> The REMA model allows for user-specification <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> parameters by strata, including the options to estimate a single, shared <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> across all strata, or define different CPUE and biomass survey strata. However, since the the auxiliary CPUE survey index is related to unobserved population biomass at the level of the biomass survey strata, the model can only accommodate scenarios where the CPUE survey strata have a coarser resolution or are equivalent to the biomass survey strata.</p>

<h4 id="the-admb-version-of-rema">The ADMB version of REMA<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-admb-version-of-rema"></a>
</h4>
<p>During the multi-survey development of REMA in ADMB, an error was introduced into the likelihood component of the CPUE survey index. Although all the equations in the ADMB template file are correctly defined, the specification of the <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{I}_{t,j})\)</span> outside (as opposed to inside) the likelihood component’s <code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code> resulted in an incorrectly specified model and invalid model results. This error was found while developing and testing the TMB version of the model and was explored in more detail using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and MLE methods. When the equation for <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{I}_{t,j})\)</span> is moved inside the <code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code>, we were able to reproduce the results using TMB. Additionally, when using MCMC methods in both the “inside” and “outside” versions, we obtained identical model results that matched the TMB and “inside” method in ADMB, providing further proof that placing this simple calculation outside the <code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code> resulted in erroneous results. A reproducible example of this issue is hosted <a href="https://github.com/JaneSullivan-NOAA/separable_function" class="external-link">Github</a>.</p>
<p>Currently two Tier 5 assessments (GOA shortspine thornyhead and GOA shortraker rockfish) and one Tier 3 apportionment strategy (GOA rougheye and blackspotted rockfish) use the erroneous version of the ADMB REMA model. Unfortunately, the biomass predictions from the erroneous ADMB model exhibit significantly less inter-annual variability (i.e. lower process error variation) than the correctly-specified REMA models. This result is attributed to the relatively low measurement error in the biomass and longline survey relative population weights (RPWs) fit in the model, which causes the PE variance estimates to be higher than one might expect for these long-lived, low productivity rockfish species. In the next section, we describe a new method for estimating additional observation error in REMA.</p>

<h3 id="estimation-of-additional-observation-error">Estimation of additional observation error<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#estimation-of-additional-observation-error"></a>
</h3>
<p>Occasions arise when the assumed observation error variance for the biomass and/or CPUE survey is lower than may be biologically realistic given inter-annual variability of survey estimates. These observation errors are based on design-based estimators used by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center’s Groundfish Assessment Group (GAP), and do not account for variability in catchability of the survey gear. In these instances, the model estimates of <span class="math inline">\((\sigma_{B_{t,j}}+\sigma_{I_{t,j}})/\sigma_{PE}\)</span> may be lower than what should be expected based on an individual species life history traits. For example, if the ratio of observation to PE variation is low, model predictions of population biomass may exhibit high inter-annual variability. This behavior would be unexpected in low productivity species, which should exhibit low inter-annual variation in biomass (i.e. low PE variance), especially in situations when fishing exploitation is low.</p>
<p>One approach to address this issue is by estimating additional observation error. This is not a novel approach; it is regularly implemented in Alaskan crab stock assessments and has been explored in several groundfish assessments as well. Using the biomass survey variance as an example, the extra estimated error (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\tau}\)</span>) is specified as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{ln(B_t)}=\sqrt{ln(\frac{\sigma_{B_t}}{B_t}^2+{\sigma_{\tau}}^2+1)}.
\]</span> This approach is a new method for Tier 5 stock assessments and apportionment methods at the AFSC. An example with GOA shortraker is outlined in Appendix B, which demonstrates that the estimation of additional observation error for the biomass and CPUE survey observations results in a better fit by AIC than status quo approaches and results in a more biologically realistic trend in population biomass.</p>

<h3 id="exploration-of-the-tweedie-distribution-for-modeling-observation-error-in-cases-with-zero-biomass-observations">Exploration of the Tweedie distribution for modeling observation error in cases with zero biomass observations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exploration-of-the-tweedie-distribution-for-modeling-observation-error-in-cases-with-zero-biomass-observations"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Tweedie distribution is a positive and continuous distribution that includes zero values, thus more naturally handling survey time series with one or more zero observations. The Tweedie distribution is defined with three parameters, a mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>), power parameter (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>), and dispersion (<span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>). The relationship between the variance and these parameters is defined by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2=\phi\mu^\rho\)</span>. In REMA, the Tweedie is constrained using a logit-transformation on <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, which bounds this parameter between 1 and 2. Values of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> on these bounds are special cases of the Tweedie distribution, where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>=1 is equivalent to a Poisson distribution and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>=2 is a gamma distribution.</p>
<p>Similar to the normal distribution, observation error variances are treated as known for the Tweedie distribution in the REMA model. Using the biomass survey observation as an example, the dispersion of the biomass observation in strata <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is derived as <span class="math display">\[
\phi_{B_{t,j}}=\frac{\sigma_{B_{t,j}}^2}{{(\hat{B}_{t,j})}^\rho}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The result is that only one additional parameter (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>) is estimated when applying this alternative distribution. The measurement equation for the Tweedie becomes <span class="math display">\[
B_{t,j} = \hat{B}_{t,j} + \epsilon_{B}, \text{where } \epsilon_{B} \sim Tw_{\rho}(0, \phi_{B_{t,j}}).
\]</span> Because <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{B_{t,j}\)</span> is undefined when <span class="math inline">\(B_{t,j}\)</span>=0, the zeros are assumed to have a CV=1.5. This assumption can be explored by the user in <code>rema</code>, for example, if the user wanted to define a CV=2.0 for zeros, they would define <code>zeros = list(assumption = 'tweedie', options_tweedie = list(zeros_cv = 2.0))</code> within the <code><a href="../reference/prepare_rema_input.html">prepare_rema_input()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>An example of using the Tweedie distribution for observation error is outlined in Appendix C using BSAI other rockfish in the EBS shelf bottom trawl survey. In this example, 13 of 38 biomass observations are zeros. While the Tweedie performs well for this example, further exploration revealed that the Tweedie models can be very slow to run and often did not converge, especially in instances where the observation error variance estimates were low. It is possible that further development on estimating additional observation error variance (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\tau}}^2\)</span> in the previous section) could alleviate these convergence errors. However, in the interim, the Tweedie distribution in REMA should be considered experimental, and we do not recommend it as a viable alternative for tactical assessments at this time.</p>
