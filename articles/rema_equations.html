</h2>
<p>The base REMA model can be represented as a simple state-space random
walk model with added noise. The observation model is comprised of an
index of log-transformed annual survey biomass estimates <span class="math inline">\(ln(B_t)\)</span> with associated standard
deviations <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{ln(B_t)}\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{ln(B_t)}\)</span> is approximated
using the coefficient of variation of <span class="math inline">\(B_t\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{B_t}/B_t\)</span>) such that <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{ln(B_t)}=\sqrt{ln((\frac{\sigma_{B_t}}{B_t})^2+1)}.
\]</span> The measurement or observation equation, which describes the
relationship between the observed survey biomass <span class="math inline">\(ln(B_t)\)</span> and the latent state variable,
population biomass <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{B}_t)\)</span>,
is expressed as <span class="math display">\[
ln(B_t) = ln(\hat{B}_t) + \epsilon_{B}, \text{where } \epsilon_{B} \sim
N(0, \sigma_{ln(B_t)}^2).
\]</span> The state equation and associated process error variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{PE}^2\)</span> is defined as <span class="math display">\[
ln(\hat{B}_{t}) = ln(\hat{B}_{t-1})+\eta_{t-1}, \text{where } \eta_t
\sim N(0, \sigma_{PE}^2),
\]</span></p>
<p>where the initial <span class="math inline">\(ln\hat{B}_{1}\)</span>
is constrained by the random walk process. In the base model, the
process error variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{PE}^2\)</span> is the only fixed effect
parameter estimated, and the unobserved population biomass <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{B}_t)\)</span> is estimated as a series of
random effects. The model is fit using marginal maximum likelihood
estimation, where the marginal negative log-likelihood is obtained via
the Laplace approximation (Skaug and Fournier 2006).</p>
<p>A reproducible example of fitting the univariate (i.e., single
stratum, single survey) version of the TMB model and comparing those
results to ADMB is available in the <a href="https://afsc-assessments.github.io/rema/articles/ex1_basics.html">REMA
basics</a> vignette.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="extending-to-multiple-biomass-survey-strata">Extending to multiple biomass survey strata<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#extending-to-multiple-biomass-survey-strata"></a>
</h3>
<p>The single survey, single stratum version of the model can be
extended to include one or more additional strata <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> from the same survey. The inclusion of
multiple strata in the same model is advantageous in scenarios where the
apportionment of biomass among areas is a desired result. This extension
assumes no correlation in the observation errors among survey strata,
though PE variance can be shared or estimated independently among
strata.</p>
<p>The ADMB and TMB versions of the REMA model utilize different methods
for estimating variance of the total predicted biomass. Therefore, while
strata-specific estimates of predicted biomass and associated confidence
intervals will be close to identical between the ADMB and TMB versions
of the model, the confidence intervals of the total predicted biomass
will differ slightly. In the original ADMB code, the Marlow (1967)
method is applied, such that the total variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_J^2\)</span> is approximated as <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_J^2 = ln\Bigg(\frac{\sum{e^{2 \hat{B}_j + \sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2}
(e^{\sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2 - 1})}} {(\sum{e^{\hat{B}_j +
\sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2/2}})^2} + 1\Bigg).
\]</span> In the updated <em>rema</em> package, the total variance is
estimated using the standard Delta method and can be replicated in ADMB
using an <code>sdreport_number</code> and in TMB using the
<code>ADREPORT</code> macro. As described in Monnahan et al. (2021), the
exploration of methods for summing log-normal variables is a research
topic that has potential impacts beyond the scope of this package.</p>
<p>A reproducible example of fitting the multivariate version of the
REMA model in TMB and a comparison of results to ADMB is available in
the <a href="https://afsc-assessments.github.io/rema/articles/ex1_basics.html">REMA
basics</a> vignette. In this example, we also show how Akaike
Information Criteria (AIC) can be used to explore the inclusion of
strata-specific versus a single, shared process error variance.</p>

</h3>
<p>In situations where an auxiliary biomass or catch per unit effort
(CPUE) survey <span class="math inline">\(I_{t}\)</span> and associated
variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{I_{t}}\)</span> are
available, an additional scaling parameter <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> can be estimated to facilitate the
inclusion of the new information into biomass predictions. The predicted
annual CPUE survey index <span class="math inline">\(\hat{I}_{t}\)</span> is calculated as <span class="math display">\[
\hat{I}_{t} = q * e^{\hat{B}_{t}}
\]</span> and the CPUE survey observations has an additional measurement
equation and likelihood component similar to the biomass survey: <span class="math display">\[
ln(I_{t}) = ln(\hat{I}_{t}) + \epsilon_{I}, \text{where } \epsilon_{I}
\sim N(0, \sigma_{ln(I_t)}^2),
\]</span> By default, <em>rema</em> estimates a single <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> for each stratum; however, users can
alternatively specify shared <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
parameters among strata. If the strata definitions are not the same for
t,he biomass and CPUE surveys (e.g. biomass is estimated at a finer
geographic resolution that CPUE), the user can define the relationship
between the two surveys’ strata using the <code>q_options</code>
argument to the <a href="https://afsc-assessments.github.io/rema/reference/prepare_rema_input.html"><code>prepare_rema_input()</code></a>
function (see <code>q_options</code> and
<code>pointer_biomass_cpue_strata)</code>. However, since the the
auxiliary CPUE survey index is related to unobserved population biomass
at the level of the biomass survey strata, the REMA model can only
accommodate scenarios where the CPUE survey strata have a coarser
resolution or are equivalent to the biomass survey strata.</p>
<p>A reproducible example of fitting to the two-survey version of the
REMA model is provided in the <a href="https://afsc-assessments.github.io/rema/articles/ex2_cpue.html">Fitting
to an additional CPUE survey vignette</a>. This example also describes
an error in the previously used ADMB version of the REMA model, and
presents several alternative models that estimate additional observation
error. These topics are described in more detail in the following two
sections.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-admb-version-of-rema">The ADMB version of REMA<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-admb-version-of-rema"></a>
</h4>
<p>Separability, as implemented in the <code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code>
in ADMB and through automatic detection in TMB, increases the
computational efficiency of the Laplace approximation by breaking
complex, multivariate integrals into a product of simpler, univariate
integrals (Fournier et al. 2012). The use of separability is
particularly relevant for state-space models as it relates to the
efficiency of the Laplace approximation of the marginal negative
log-likelihood and integration of the random effects from the joint
negative log-likelihood. In the random effects implementation of ADMB,
parameters defined inside the <code>PARAMETER_SECTION</code> of the
template file cannot be used within the <code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code>
unless they are passed as arguments to the function (Skaug and Fournier
2013). In the ADMB version of the REMA model, the calculation of
predicted CPUE [i.e. <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{I}_{t})=ln(q)+ln(\hat{B})\)</span>]
occurred outside rather than inside the <code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code>,
and as a results, violated this rule and affecting the accuracy of the
Laplace approximation.</p>
<p>We explored this error in a <a href="https://github.com/JaneSullivan-NOAA/separable_function" class="external-link">simplified
example</a> of the REMA model in both ADMB and TMB. We were able to
reproduce results from the TMB version of REMA in ADMB by passing <span class="math inline">\(ln(q)\)</span> as an argument to the
<code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code> and performing the <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{I}_{t})\)</span> calculation inside the
<code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code>. When we used Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods for statistical inference instead of MLE, the results
from both ADMB versions closely matched the correct version of REMA.
Finally, a comparison of the individual negative log-likelihood (NLL)
components, along with the joint and marginal NLLs, revealed that all
were the same between the TMB model, correct “inside” ADMB version, and
incorrect “outside” ADMB version, <em>except</em> the marginal NLL.
Taken together, this analysis confirms there is a bug in the “outside”
ADMB version, which affects the accuracy of the Laplace approximation
and model results.</p>

<h3 id="estimation-of-additional-observation-error">Estimation of additional observation error<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#estimation-of-additional-observation-error"></a>
</h3>
<p>Based on experience gained using alternative observed index estimates
(e.g., relative CPUE indices), there appears to be cases where the
estimates of observation error variances for the biomass and/or CPUE
survey are too low (e.g., Echave et al. 2020). That is, there is a
mismatch between biologically reasonable inter-annual variability and
the precision of index estimates. In these instances, the model
estimates of <span class="math inline">\((\sigma^2_{B_{t,j}}+\sigma^2_{I_{t,j}})/\sigma^2_{PE}\)</span>
may be lower than what should be expected based on an individual species
life history traits. For example, if the ratio of observation to PE
variation is low, model predictions of population biomass may exhibit
high inter-annual variability. This behavior would be unexpected in low
productivity species, which should exhibit low inter-annual variation in
biomass (i.e. low PE variance), especially in situations when fishing
exploitation is low.</p>
<p>One approach to addressing this issue is to estimate additional
observation error. This method is commonly implemented in Stock
Synthesis, has been implemented in Alaskan crab stock assessments (Zheng
and Siddeek 2020), and has been explored in several groundfish
assessments as well. Using the biomass survey variance as an example,
the extra estimated error (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\tau}\)</span>) is specified as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{ln(B_t)}=\sqrt{ln((\frac{\sigma_{B_t}}{B_t})^2+{\sigma_{\tau}}^2+1)}.
\]</span> This approach is a new method for Tier 5 stock assessments and
apportionment methods at the AFSC. A reproducible example with GOA
shortraker is outlined in the <a href="https://afsc-assessments.github.io/rema/articles/ex2_cpue.html">Fitting
to an additional CPUE survey</a>. In this example, the estimation of
additional observation error for the biomass and CPUE survey resulted in
a better fit by AIC than status quo approaches and has a more
biologically realistic trend in predicted population biomass.</p>

<h3 id="exploration-of-the-tweedie-distribution-for-zero-biomass-observations">Exploration of the Tweedie distribution for zero biomass
observations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exploration-of-the-tweedie-distribution-for-zero-biomass-observations"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweedie_distribution" class="external-link">Tweedie
distributions</a> are a family of probability distributions that can be
generalized to include the Gaussian, inverse Gaussian, gamma, Poisson,
and compound Poisson-gamma distributions. The Tweedie distribution can
be defined with three parameters, a mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>), power parameter (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>), and dispersion (<span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>), where the relationship between the
variance and these parameters is defined by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2=\phi\mu^\rho\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is bounded between 1 and 2, the
Tweedie is a positive, continuous distribution that can handle zero
values, thus allowing it to more naturally handle survey time series
with one or more zero observations. Values of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> on these bounds are special cases of
the Tweedie distribution, where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>=1 is equivalent to a Poisson
distribution and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>=2 is a gamma
distribution. In <em>rema</em>, the Tweedie <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is constrained between 1 and 2 using
a logit-transformation.</p>
<p>Similar to the normal distribution, observation error variances are
treated as known for the Tweedie distribution in the REMA model. Using
the biomass survey observation as an example, the dispersion of the
biomass observation in strata <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in
year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is derived as <span class="math display">\[
\phi_{B_{t,j}}=\frac{\sigma_{B_{t,j}}^2}{{(\hat{B}_{t,j})}^\rho}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The result is that only one additional parameter (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>) is estimated when applying this
alternative distribution. The measurement equation for the Tweedie
becomes <span class="math display">\[
B_{t,j} = \hat{B}_{t,j} + \epsilon_{B}, \text{where } \epsilon_{B} \sim
Tw_{\rho}(0, \phi_{B_{t,j}}).
\]</span> Because <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{B_{t,j}}\)</span>
is undefined when <span class="math inline">\(B_{t,j}\)</span>=0, the
zeros are assumed to have a CV=1.5. This assumption can be explored by
the user in <code>rema</code>, for example, if the user wanted to define
a CV=2.0 for zeros, they would define
<code>zeros = list(assumption = 'tweedie', options_tweedie = list(zeros_cv = 2.0))</code>
within the <code><a href="../reference/prepare_rema_input.html">prepare_rema_input()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>A reproducible example using the Tweedie distribution for observation
error is outlined in the <a href="https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex3_zeros.html" class="external-link">Strategies
for handling zero biomass observations</a> vignette. We use the
non-shortspine thornyhead component of the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands
other rockfish stock, which is unique in that 13 of 38 bottom trawl
survey biomass estimates are zeros. While the Tweedie performs well for
this case, further exploration revealed that the Tweedie models can be
very slow to run and often did not converge, especially in instances
where the observation error variance estimates were low. It is possible
that further development on estimating additional observation error
variance (e.g. <span class="math inline">\({\tau}^2\)</span> in the
previous section) could alleviate these convergence errors. However, in
the interim, the Tweedie distribution in <em>rema</em> should be
considered experimental, and we do not recommend it as a viable
alternative for tactical assessments at this time.</p>

<h3 id="experimental-one-step-ahead-osa-residuals">Experimental One-Step Ahead (OSA) residuals<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#experimental-one-step-ahead-osa-residuals"></a>
</h3>
<p>The use of one-step ahead (OSA) residuals, also referred to as
forecast residuals or prediction errors, is crucial for validation of
state-space models like REMA (Thygesen et al. 2017). Instead of
comparing the observed and expected values at the same time step, OSA
residuals use forecasted values based on all previous observations
(i.e. they exclude the observed value at the current time step from
prediction). Traditional residuals (e.g. Pearson’s residuals) are
inappropriate for state-space models, because process error variance may
be over-estimated in cases where the model is mispecified, thus leading
to artificially small residuals (see Section 3 of Thygesen et al. 2017
for an example).</p>
<p>Methods for calculating OSA residuals have been implemented in TMB
through the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/TMB/man/oneStepPredict.html" class="external-link">TMB::oneStepPredict()</a></code> function. While these
methods are straight forward to implement in TMB, they are
computationally demanding, and the validity (and accuracy) of the OSA
residuals may vary by situation and method used. Methods to implement
OSA residuals in <em>rema</em> are under development and should be
considered experimental. Currently, OSA residuals are implemented using
the <code>method = "cdf"</code> option in
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/TMB/man/oneStepPredict.html" class="external-link">TMB::oneStepPredict()</a></code>, which has the benefit of speeding up
residual calculations by saving copies of the one-step cumulative
density function at each data point and thus reducing the number of
calculations at each function evaluation. While OSA residuals appear to
be calculated correctly for some REMA models, occasionally
<code>NaN</code> values for residuals are returned, especially in cases
with small measurement errors. One potential cause of this error may lie
in the initialization of the state process within the REMA model and
will be explored further in future versions of this package.</p>
