</h2>
<p>The base REMA model can be represented as a simple state-space random walk model with added noise. The observation model is comprised of an index of log-transformed annual survey biomass estimates <span class="math inline">\(ln(B_t)\)</span> with associated standard deviations <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{ln(B_t)}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{ln(B_t)}\)</span> is approximated using the coefficient of variation of <span class="math inline">\(B_t\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{B_t}/B_t\)</span>) such that <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{ln(B_t)}=\sqrt{ln(\frac{\sigma_{B_t}}{B_t}^2+1)}.
\]</span> The measurement or observation equation, which describes the relationship between the observed survey biomass <span class="math inline">\(ln(B_t)\)</span> and the latent state variable, population biomass <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{B}_t)\)</span>. The measurement equation is expressed as <span class="math display">\[
ln(B_t) = ln(\hat{B}_t) + \epsilon_{B}, \text{where } \epsilon_{B} \sim N(0, \sigma_{ln(B_t)}^2), 
\]</span> while the state equation and associated process error variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{PE}^2\)</span> is defined as <span class="math display">\[
ln(\hat{B}_{t+1}) = ln(\hat{B}_t)+\eta_t, \text{where } \eta_t \sim N(0, \sigma_{PE}^2). 
\]</span> In the base model, the process error variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{PE}^2\)</span> is the only fixed effect parameter estimated, and the unobserved population biomass <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{B}_t)\)</span> is estimated as a series of random effects. The model is fit using maximum likelihood estimation, where the Laplace approximation is used to approximate the marginal negative log-likelihood in both TMB and ADMB. An example of fitting the single stratum, single survey version of REMA and comparing results with the ADMB is illustrated in Example 1 of the <a href="https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex1_basics.html" class="external-link">“REMA basics” vignette</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extending-to-multiple-biomass-survey-strata">Extending to multiple biomass survey strata<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#extending-to-multiple-biomass-survey-strata"></a>
</h3>
<p>The single survey, single stratum version of the model can be extended to include one or more additional strata <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> from the same survey. The inclusion of multiple strata in the same model is advantageous in scenarios where the apportionment of biomass among areas is a desired result. This extension assumes no correlation in the observation errors among survey strata, though PE variance can be shared or estimated independently among strata. An example of using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to explore the inclusion of strata-specific PE variances versus a single, shared PE is outlined in example 2 of the <a href="https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex1_basics.html" class="external-link">“REMA basics” vignette</a>.</p>
<p>The ADMB and TMB versions of REMA utilize different methods for estimating variance of the total predicted biomass. Therefore, while strata-specific estimates of predicted biomass and associated confidence intervals will be identical between the ADMB and TMB versions of the model, the confidence intervals of the total predicted biomass will differ slightly. In the original ADMB code, the Marlow (1967) method is applied, such that the total variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_J^2\)</span> is approximated as <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_J^2 = ln\Bigg(\frac{\sum{e^{2 \hat{B}_j + \sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2} (e^{\sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2 - 1})}} {(\sum{e^{\hat{B}_j + \sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2/2}})^2} + 1\Bigg).
\]</span> In the updated REMA library, the total variance is estimated using the standard Delta method and can be replicated in ADMB using an <code>sdreport_number</code> and in TMB using the <code>ADREPORT</code> macro. As described in Monnahan et al. (2021), the exploration of methods for summing log-normal variables is a research topic that has potential impacts beyond the scope of REMA.</p>

</h3>
<p>In situations where an auxiliary biomass or catch per unit effort (CPUE) survey <span class="math inline">\(I_{t}\)</span> and associated variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{I_{t}}\)</span> are available, an additional scaling parameter <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> can be estimated to facilitate the inclusion of the new information into biomass predictions. The predicted annual CPUE survey index <span class="math inline">\(\hat{I}_{t}\)</span> is calculated as <span class="math display">\[
\hat{I}_{t} = q * e^{\hat{B}_{t}}
\]</span> and the CPUE survey observations has an additional measurement equation and likelihood component similar to the biomass survey: <span class="math display">\[
ln(I_{t}) = ln(\hat{I}_{t}) + \epsilon_{I}, \text{where } \epsilon_{I} \sim N(0, \sigma_{ln(I_t)}^2), 
\]</span> By default, REMA estimates a single <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> for each stratum. REMA allows for user-specification of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> parameters by strata, including the option to estimate a single, shared <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> across all strata. If the strata definitions are not the same for the biomass and CPUE surveys (e.g. biomass is estimated at a finer geographic resolution that CPUE), the user must manually define the mapping between the two surveys’ strata. However, since the the auxiliary CPUE survey index is related to unobserved population biomass at the level of the biomass survey strata, the REMA can only accommodate scenarios where the CPUE survey strata have a coarser resolution or are equivalent to the biomass survey strata.</p>
<p>An example with GOA shortraker is outlined in the <a href="https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex2_cpue.html" class="external-link">“Fitting to an additional CPUE survey” vignette</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-admb-version-of-rema">The ADMB version of REMA<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-admb-version-of-rema"></a>
</h4>
<p>Separability, as implemented in the <code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code> in ADMB and through automatic detection in TMB, increases computational efficiency of optimization routines by breaking complex, multivariate integrals into a product of simpler, univariate integrals (Fournier et al. 2012). The use of separability is particularly relevant for state-space models as it relates to the efficiency of the Laplace approximation of the marginal negative log-likelihood and integration of the random effects from the joint negative log-likelihood. In the random effects implementation of ADMB (ADMB-RE), parameters defined in the <code>PARAMETER_SECTION</code> of the template file cannot be used within the <code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code> unless they are passed as arguments to the function (Skaug and Fournier 2013). In the ADMB version of REMA, the calculation of predicted CPUE [i.e. <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{I}_{t})=ln(q)+ln(\hat{B})\)</span>] outside rather than inside the <code>SEPARABLE_FUNCTION</code> violates this rule, thus introducing an error into the program that prevents accurate implementation of the Laplace approximation.</p>
<p>We explored this error in a simplified example of REMA in both ADMB and TMB, which is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/JaneSullivan-NOAA/separable_function" class="external-link">Github</a>. We were able to reproduce results from the TMB version of REMA in ADMB by passing <span class="math inline">\(ln(q)\)</span> as an argument to the SEPARABLE_FUNCTION and performing the <span class="math inline">\(ln(\hat{I}_{t})\)</span> calculation inside the function (Figure x). Additionally, when we used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for statistical inference instead of MLE, the results from both ADMB versions closely matched the correct version of REMA. Finally, a comparison of the individual negative log-likelihood (NLL) components, along with the joint and marginal NLLs, revealed that all were the same between the TMB model, correct “inside” ADMB version, and incorrect “outside” ADMB version, <em>except</em> the marginal NLL. Taken together, this analysis demonstrates an error in the calculations of the Laplace approximation in the “outside” version of the ADMB REMA model.</p>
<p>Currently one Tier 3 apportionment model (GOA rougheye and blackspotted rockfish) and two Tier 5 assessments (GOA shortspine thornyhead and GOA shortraker rockfish) use the invalid version of the ADMB REMA model. The biomass predictions from this version exhibit significantly less inter-annual variability (i.e. lower PE variation) than the correctly-specified REMA models. In the correct versions of REMA, this result is attributed to the relatively high precision of the biomass and longline survey relative population weights (RPWs), which translates to high PE variance and model predictions that closely track inter-annual variability in the data. This model behavior is biologically unrealistic for the long-lived, low productivity rockfish species that currently use the multi-survey version of REMA.</p>
<p>One option for authors may be to remove the longline survey RPW index entirely from the model and only fit to trawl survey biomass. However, the species that currently use the two-survey model do so because they are well-sampled by the longline survey. Additionally, the two-survey approach may reduce data gaps following survey reductions. For example, the EBS Slope bottom trawl survey was last conducted in 2016. At least two species’ stock assessments, shortspine thornyhead and shortraker rockfish, currently rely on the 2016 estimate from the EBS slope survey in that region to inform ABC calculations. Instead of omitting the longline survey from the model, we propose an alternative method for estimating additional observation error.</p>

<h3 id="estimation-of-additional-observation-error">Estimation of additional observation error<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#estimation-of-additional-observation-error"></a>
</h3>
<p>Occasions arise when the assumed observation error variance for the biomass and/or CPUE survey is lower than may be biologically realistic given inter-annual variability of survey estimates. In these instances, the model estimates of <span class="math inline">\((\sigma_{B_{t,j}}+\sigma_{I_{t,j}})/\sigma_{PE}\)</span> may be lower than what should be expected based on an individual species life history traits. For example, if the ratio of observation to PE variation is low, model predictions of population biomass may exhibit high inter-annual variability. This behavior would be unexpected in low productivity species, which should exhibit low inter-annual variation in biomass (i.e. low PE variance), especially in situations when fishing exploitation is low.</p>
<p>One approach to addressing this issue is to estimate additional observation error. This is not a novel approach; it is regularly implemented in Alaskan crab stock assessments and has been explored in several groundfish assessments as well. Using the biomass survey variance as an example, the extra estimated error (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\tau}\)</span>) is specified as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{ln(B_t)}=\sqrt{ln(\frac{\sigma_{B_t}}{B_t}^2+{\sigma_{\tau}}^2+1)}.
\]</span> This approach is a new method for Tier 5 stock assessments and apportionment methods at the AFSC. An example with GOA shortraker is outlined in the <a href="https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex2_cpue.html" class="external-link">“Fitting to an additional CPUE survey” vignette</a>, which demonstrates that the estimation of additional observation error for the biomass and CPUE survey observations results in a better fit by AIC than status quo approaches and results in a more biologically realistic trend in population biomass.</p>

<h3 id="exploration-of-the-tweedie-distribution-for-modeling-observation-error-in-cases-with-zero-biomass-observations">Exploration of the Tweedie distribution for modeling observation error in cases with zero biomass observations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exploration-of-the-tweedie-distribution-for-modeling-observation-error-in-cases-with-zero-biomass-observations"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Tweedie distribution is a positive and continuous distribution that includes zero values, thus more naturally handling survey time series with one or more zero observations. The Tweedie distribution is defined with three parameters, a mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>), power parameter (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>), and dispersion (<span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>). The relationship between the variance and these parameters is defined by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2=\phi\mu^\rho\)</span>. In REMA, the Tweedie is constrained using a logit-transformation on <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, which bounds this parameter between 1 and 2. Values of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> on these bounds are special cases of the Tweedie distribution, where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>=1 is equivalent to a Poisson distribution and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>=2 is a gamma distribution.</p>
<p>Similar to the normal distribution, observation error variances are treated as known for the Tweedie distribution in the REMA model. Using the biomass survey observation as an example, the dispersion of the biomass observation in strata <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is derived as <span class="math display">\[
\phi_{B_{t,j}}=\frac{\sigma_{B_{t,j}}^2}{{(\hat{B}_{t,j})}^\rho}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The result is that only one additional parameter (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>) is estimated when applying this alternative distribution. The measurement equation for the Tweedie becomes <span class="math display">\[
B_{t,j} = \hat{B}_{t,j} + \epsilon_{B}, \text{where } \epsilon_{B} \sim Tw_{\rho}(0, \phi_{B_{t,j}}).
\]</span> Because <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{B_{t,j}}\)</span> is undefined when <span class="math inline">\(B_{t,j}\)</span>=0, the zeros are assumed to have a CV=1.5. This assumption can be explored by the user in <code>rema</code>, for example, if the user wanted to define a CV=2.0 for zeros, they would define <code>zeros = list(assumption = 'tweedie', options_tweedie = list(zeros_cv = 2.0))</code> within the <code><a href="../reference/prepare_rema_input.html">prepare_rema_input()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>An example of using the Tweedie distribution for observation error is outlined in the <a href="https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex3_zeros.html" class="external-link">“Strategies for handling zero biomass observations” vignette</a> using BSAI other rockfish in the EBS shelf bottom trawl survey. In this example, 13 of 38 biomass observations are zeros. While the Tweedie performs well for this case, further exploration revealed that the Tweedie models can be very slow to run and often did not converge, especially in instances where the observation error variance estimates were low. It is possible that further development on estimating additional observation error variance (e.g. <span class="math inline">\({\tau}^2\)</span> in the previous section) could alleviate these convergence errors. However, in the interim, the Tweedie distribution in REMA should be considered experimental, and we do not recommend it as a viable alternative for tactical assessments at this time.</p>

<h3 id="experimental-one-step-ahead-osa-residuals">Experimental One-Step Ahead (OSA) residuals<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#experimental-one-step-ahead-osa-residuals"></a>
</h3>
<p>The use of one-step ahead (OSA) residuals, also referred to as forecast residuals or prediction errors, is crucial for validation of state-space models like REMA (Thygesen et al. 2017). Instead of comparing the observed and expected values at the same time step, OSA residuals use forecasted values based on all previous observations (i.e. they exclude the observed value at the current time step from prediction). Traditional residuals (e.g. Pearson’s residuals) are inappropriate for state-space models, because process error variance may be over-estimated in cases where the model is mispecified, thus leading to artificially small residuals (see Section 3 of Thygesen et al. 2017 for an example).</p>
<p>Methods for calculating OSA residuals have been implemented in TMB through the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/TMB/man/oneStepPredict.html" class="external-link">TMB::oneStepPredict()</a></code> function. While these methods are straight forward to implement in TMB, they are computationally demanding, and the validity (and accuracy) of the OSA residuals may vary by situation and method used. Methods to implement OSA residuals in REMA are under development and should be considered experimental. Currently REMA implements OSA residuals using the <code>method = "cdf"</code> option in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/TMB/man/oneStepPredict.html" class="external-link">TMB::oneStepPredict()</a></code>, which has the benefit of speeding up residual calculations by saving copies of the one-step cumulative density function at each data point and thus reducing the number of calculations at each function evaluation. While OSA residuals appear to be calculated correctly for some REMA models, occasionally <code>NaN</code> values for residuals are returned, especially in cases with small measurement errors. One potential cause of this error may lie in the initialization of the state process within REMA and will be explored further in future versions of this package. Finally, the algorithms underpinning <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/TMB/man/oneStepPredict.html" class="external-link">TMB::oneStepPredict()</a></code> methods are an area of active research, and therefore this function remains in Beta mode within the TMB package and is subject to future change.</p>
