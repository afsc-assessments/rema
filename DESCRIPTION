Description: This package provides a generalized framework to fit the random effects (RE) model, 
    a state-space random walk model developed at the Alaska Fisheries Science 
    Center (AFSC) for smoothing survey biomass estimates and apportioning catch among management areas. REMA is a multivariate 
    extension of the original single-survey, single-strata RE model that allows 
    the use of multiple strata within a survey and an additional survey (e.g. CPUE 
    or relative population numbers) to inform the biomass trend (Hulson et al. 2021). 
    If multi-survey mode is turned off, REMA runs the same as the univariate (RE) 
    and multivariate (i.e. multiple area or depth strata; REM) versions of the 
    model. REMA was developed in Template Model Builder (TMB; Kristensen et al. 2016).
