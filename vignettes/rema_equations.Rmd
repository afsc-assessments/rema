# Basic model structure

The base REMA model can be represented as a simple state-space random
walk model with added noise. The observation model is comprised of an
index of log-transformed annual survey biomass estimates $ln(B_t)$ with
associated standard deviations $\sigma_{ln(B_t)}$, where
$\sigma_{ln(B_t)}$ is approximated using the coefficient of variation of
$B_t$ ($\sigma_{B_t}/B_t$) such that $$
\sigma_{ln(B_t)}=\sqrt{ln(\frac{\sigma_{B_t}}{B_t}^2+1)}.
$$ The measurement or observation equation, which describes the
relationship between the observed survey biomass $ln(B_t)$ and the
latent state variable, population biomass $ln(\hat{B}_t)$. The
measurement equation is expressed as $$
ln(B_t) = ln(\hat{B}_t) + \epsilon_{B}, \text{where } \epsilon_{B} \sim N(0, \sigma_{ln(B_t)}^2), 
$$ while the state equation and associated process error variance
$\sigma_{PE}^2$ is defined as $$
ln(\hat{B}_{t+1}) = ln(\hat{B}_t)+\eta_t, \text{where } \eta_t \sim N(0, \sigma_{PE}^2). 
$$ In the base model, the process error variance $\sigma_{PE}^2$ is the
only fixed effect parameter estimated, and the unobserved population
biomass $ln(\hat{B}_t)$ is estimated as a series of random effects. The
model is fit using maximum likelihood estimation, where the Laplace
approximation is used to approximate the marginal negative
log-likelihood in both TMB and ADMB. An example of fitting the single
stratum, single survey version of REMA and comparing results with the
ADMB is illustrated in Example 1 of the ["REMA basics"
vignette](https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex1_basics.html).

## Extending to multiple biomass survey strata

The single survey, single stratum version of the model can be extended
to include one or more additional strata $j$ from the same survey. The
inclusion of multiple strata in the same model is advantageous in
scenarios where the apportionment of biomass among areas is a desired
result. This extension assumes no correlation in the observation errors
among survey strata, though PE variance can be shared or estimated
independently among strata. An example of using Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) to explore the inclusion of strata-specific PE variances
versus a single, shared PE is outlined in example 2 of the ["REMA
basics"
vignette](https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex1_basics.html).

The ADMB and TMB versions of REMA utilize different methods for
estimating variance of the total predicted biomass. Therefore, while
strata-specific estimates of predicted biomass and associated confidence
intervals will be identical between the ADMB and TMB versions of the
model, the confidence intervals of the total predicted biomass will
differ slightly. In the original ADMB code, the Marlow (1967) method is
applied, such that the total variance $\sigma_J^2$ is approximated as $$
\sigma_J^2 = ln\Bigg(\frac{\sum{e^{2 \hat{B}_j + \sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2} (e^{\sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2 - 1})}} {(\sum{e^{\hat{B}_j + \sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2/2}})^2} + 1\Bigg).
$$ In the updated REMA library, the total variance is estimated using
the standard Delta method and can be replicated in ADMB using an
`sdreport_number` and in TMB using the `ADREPORT` macro. As described in
Monnahan et al. (2021), the exploration of methods for summing
log-normal variables is a research topic that has potential impacts
beyond the scope of REMA.

## Addition of an auxiliary catch per unit effort (CPUE) survey

In situations where an auxiliary biomass or catch per unit effort (CPUE)
survey $I_{t}$ and associated variance $\sigma_{I_{t}}$ are available,
an additional scaling parameter $q$ can be estimated to facilitate the
inclusion of the new information into biomass predictions. The predicted
annual CPUE survey index $\hat{I}_{t}$ is calculated as $$
\hat{I}_{t} = q * e^{\hat{B}_{t}}
$$ and the CPUE survey observations has an additional measurement
equation and likelihood component similar to the biomass survey: $$
ln(I_{t}) = ln(\hat{I}_{t}) + \epsilon_{I}, \text{where } \epsilon_{I} \sim N(0, \sigma_{ln(I_t)}^2), 
$$ By default, REMA estimates a single $q$ for each stratum. REMA allows
for user-specification of $q$ parameters by strata, including the option
to estimate a single, shared $q$ across all strata. If the strata
definitions are not the same for the biomass and CPUE surveys (e.g.
biomass is estimated at a finer geographic resolution that CPUE), the
user must manually define the mapping between the two surveys' strata.
However, since the the auxiliary CPUE survey index is related to
unobserved population biomass at the level of the biomass survey strata,
the REMA can only accommodate scenarios where the CPUE survey strata
have a coarser resolution or are equivalent to the biomass survey
strata.

An example with GOA shortraker is outlined in the ["Fitting to an
additional CPUE survey"
vignette](https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex2_cpue.html).

### The ADMB version of REMA

Separability, as implemented in the `SEPARABLE_FUNCTION` in ADMB and
through automatic detection in TMB, increases computational efficiency
of optimization routines by breaking complex, multivariate integrals
into a product of simpler, univariate integrals (Fournier et al. 2012).
The use of separability is particularly relevant for state-space models
as it relates to the efficiency of the Laplace approximation of the
marginal negative log-likelihood and integration of the random effects
from the joint negative log-likelihood. In the random effects
implementation of ADMB (ADMB-RE), parameters defined in the
`PARAMETER_SECTION` of the template file cannot be used within the
`SEPARABLE_FUNCTION` unless they are passed as arguments to the function
(Skaug and Fournier 2013). In the ADMB version of REMA, the calculation
of predicted CPUE [i.e. $ln(\hat{I}_{t})=ln(q)+ln(\hat{B})$] outside
rather than inside the `SEPARABLE_FUNCTION` violates this rule, thus
introducing an error into the program that prevents accurate
implementation of the Laplace approximation.

We explored this error in a simplified example of REMA in both ADMB and
TMB, which is hosted on
[Github](https://github.com/JaneSullivan-NOAA/separable_function). We
were able to reproduce results from the TMB version of REMA in ADMB by
passing $ln(q)$ as an argument to the SEPARABLE_FUNCTION and performing
the $ln(\hat{I}_{t})$ calculation inside the function (Figure x).
Additionally, when we used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for
statistical inference instead of MLE, the results from both ADMB
versions closely matched the correct version of REMA. Finally, a
comparison of the individual negative log-likelihood (NLL) components,
along with the joint and marginal NLLs, revealed that all were the same
between the TMB model, correct "inside" ADMB version, and incorrect
"outside" ADMB version, *except* the marginal NLL. Taken together, this
analysis demonstrates an error in the calculations of the Laplace
approximation in the "outside" version of the ADMB REMA model.

Currently one Tier 3 apportionment model (GOA rougheye and blackspotted
rockfish) and two Tier 5 assessments (GOA shortspine thornyhead and GOA
shortraker rockfish) use the invalid version of the ADMB REMA model. The
biomass predictions from this version exhibit significantly less
inter-annual variability (i.e. lower PE variation) than the
correctly-specified REMA models. In the correct versions of REMA, this
result is attributed to the relatively high precision of the biomass and
longline survey relative population weights (RPWs), which translates to
high PE variance and model predictions that closely track inter-annual
variability in the data. This model behavior is is biologically
unrealistic for the long-lived, low productivity rockfish species that
currently use the multi-survey version of REMA.

One option for authors may be to remove the longline survey RPW index
entirely from the model and only fit to trawl survey biomass. However,
the species that currently use the two-survey model do so because they
are well-sampled by the longline survey. Additionally, the two-survey
approach may reduce data gaps following survey reductions. For example,
the EBS Slope bottom trawl survey was last conducted in 2016. At least
two species' stock assessments, shortspine thornyhead and shortraker
rockfish, currently rely on the 2016 estimate from the EBS slope survey
in that region to inform ABC calculations. Instead of omitting the
longline survey from the model, we propose an alternative method for
estimating additional observation error.

## Estimation of additional observation error

Occasions arise when the assumed observation error variance for the
biomass and/or CPUE survey is lower than may be biologically realistic
given inter-annual variability of survey estimates. In these instances,
the model estimates of $(\sigma_{B_{t,j}}+\sigma_{I_{t,j}})/\sigma_{PE}$
may be lower than what should be expected based on an individual species
life history traits. For example, if the ratio of observation to PE
variation is low, model predictions of population biomass may exhibit
high inter-annual variability. This behavior would be unexpected in low
productivity species, which should exhibit low inter-annual variation in
biomass (i.e. low PE variance), especially in situations when fishing
exploitation is low.

One approach to addressing this issue is to estimate additional
observation error. This is not a novel approach; it is regularly
implemented in Alaskan crab stock assessments and has been explored in
several groundfish assessments as well. Using the biomass survey
variance as an example, the extra estimated error ($\sigma_{\tau}$) is
specified as:

$$
\sigma_{ln(B_t)}=\sqrt{ln(\frac{\sigma_{B_t}}{B_t}^2+{\sigma_{\tau}}^2+1)}.
$$ This approach is a new method for Tier 5 stock assessments and
apportionment methods at the AFSC. An example with GOA shortraker is
outlined in the ["Fitting to an additional CPUE survey"
vignette](https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex2_cpue.html),
which demonstrates that the estimation of additional observation error
for the biomass and CPUE survey observations results in a better fit by
AIC than status quo approaches and results in a more biologically
realistic trend in population biomass.

## Exploration of the Tweedie distribution for modeling observation error in cases with zero biomass observations

The Tweedie distribution is a positive and continuous distribution that
includes zero values, thus more naturally handling survey time series
with one or more zero observations. The Tweedie distribution is defined
with three parameters, a mean ($\mu$), power parameter ($\rho$), and
dispersion ($\phi$). The relationship between the variance and these
parameters is defined by $\sigma^2=\phi\mu^\rho$. In REMA, the Tweedie
is constrained using a logit-transformation on $\rho$, which bounds this
parameter between 1 and 2. Values of $\rho$ on these bounds are special
cases of the Tweedie distribution, where $\rho$=1 is equivalent to a
Poisson distribution and $\rho$=2 is a gamma distribution.

Similar to the normal distribution, observation error variances are
treated as known for the Tweedie distribution in the REMA model. Using
the biomass survey observation as an example, the dispersion of the
biomass observation in strata $j$ in year $t$ is derived as $$
\phi_{B_{t,j}}=\frac{\sigma_{B_{t,j}}^2}{{(\hat{B}_{t,j})}^\rho}.
$$

The result is that only one additional parameter ($\rho$) is estimated
when applying this alternative distribution. The measurement equation
for the Tweedie becomes $$
B_{t,j} = \hat{B}_{t,j} + \epsilon_{B}, \text{where } \epsilon_{B} \sim Tw_{\rho}(0, \phi_{B_{t,j}}).
$$ Because $\sigma_{B_{t,j}}$ is undefined when $B_{t,j}$=0, the zeros
are assumed to have a CV=1.5. This assumption can be explored by the
user in `rema`, for example, if the user wanted to define a CV=2.0 for
zeros, they would define
`zeros = list(assumption = 'tweedie', options_tweedie = list(zeros_cv = 2.0))`
within the `prepare_rema_input()` function.

An example of using the Tweedie distribution for observation error is
outlined in the ["Strategies for handling zero biomass observations"
vignette](https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex3_zeros.html)
using BSAI other rockfish in the EBS shelf bottom trawl survey. In this
example, 13 of 38 biomass observations are zeros. While the Tweedie
performs well for this case, further exploration revealed that the
Tweedie models can be very slow to run and often did not converge,
especially in instances where the observation error variance estimates
were low. It is possible that further development on estimating
additional observation error variance (e.g. ${\tau}^2$ in the previous
section) could alleviate these convergence errors. However, in the
interim, the Tweedie distribution in REMA should be considered
experimental, and we do not recommend it as a viable alternative for
tactical assessments at this time.

## Experimental One-Step Ahead (OSA) residuals

The use of one-step ahead (OSA) residuals, also referred to as forecast
residuals or prediction errors, is crucial for validation of state-space
models like REMA (Thygesen et al. 2017). Instead of comparing the
observed and expected values at the same time step, OSA residuals use
forecasted values based on all previous observations (i.e. they exclude
the observed value at the current time step from prediction).
Traditional residuals (e.g. Pearson's residuals) are inappropriate for
state-space models, because process error variance may be over-estimated
in cases where the model is mispecified, thus leading to artificially
small residuals (see Section 3 of Thygesen et al. 2017 for an example).

Methods for calculating OSA residuals have been implemented in TMB
through the `TMB::oneStepPredict()` function. While these methods are
relatively easy to implement in TMB, they are computationally demanding
and the validity (and accuracy) of the OSA residuals may vary by
situation and method used. Methods to implement OSA residuals in REMA
are under development and should be considered experimental. Currently
REMA implements OSA residuals using the `method = "cdf"` option in
`TMB::oneStepPredict()`, which has the benefit of speeding up residual
calculations by saving copies of the one-step cumulative density
function at each data point and thus reducing the number of calculations
at each function evaluation. While OSA residuals appear to be calculated
correctly for some REMA models, occasionally `NaN` values for residuals
are returned, especially in cases with small measurement errors. One
potential cause of this error may lie in the initialization of the state
process within REMA and will be explored further in future versions of
this package. Finally, the algorithms underpinning
`TMB::oneStepPredict()` methods are an area of active research, and
therefore this function remains in Beta mode within the TMB package and
is subject to future change.
