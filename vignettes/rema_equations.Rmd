# Basic model structure

The base REMA model can be represented as a simple state-space random
walk model with added noise. The observation model is comprised of an
index of log-transformed annual survey biomass $ln(B_t)$ estimates with
associated standard deviations $\sigma_{ln(B_t)}$, where
$\sigma_{ln(B_t)}$ is approximated using the coefficient of variation of
$B_t$ ($\sigma_{B_t}/B_t$) such that $$
\sigma_{ln(B_t)}=\sqrt{ln(\frac{\sigma_{B_t}}{B_t}^2+1)}
$$ The measurement or observation equation, which describes the
relationship between the observed survey biomass $ln(B_t)$ and the
latent state variable, the population biomass $ln(\hat{B}_t)$. The
measurement equation is expressed as $$
ln(B_t) = ln(\hat{B}_t) + \epsilon_{B}, \text{where } \epsilon_{B} \sim N(0, \sigma_{ln(B_t)}^2), 
$$ while the state equation and associated process error variance
($\sigma_{PE}^2$) is defined as $$
ln(\hat{B}_{t+1}) = ln(\hat{B}_t)+\eta_t, \text{where } \eta_t \sim N(0, \sigma_{PE}^2). 
$$ In the base model, the process error variance $\sigma_{PE}^2$ is the
only fixed effect parameter estimated, and the unobserved population
biomass $ln(\hat{B}_t)$ is estimated as a series of random effects. The
model specified above is fit using maximum likelihood estimation, where
the Laplace approximation is used to integrate out random effects in
both TMB and ADMB. An example of the fitting the single stratum, single
survey version of the model in TMB and comparing results with the ADMB
is illustrated in example 1 of the ["REMA basics"
vignette](https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex1_basics.html).

## Extending to multiple biomass survey strata

The single survey, single stratum version of the model can be extended
to include one or more additional strata $j$ from the same survey. The
inclusion of multiple strata in the same model is advantageous in
scenarios where the apportionment of biomass among areas is a desired
result. This extension assumes no correlation in the observation errors
among survey strata, though PE variance can be shared or estimated
independently among strata. An example of using Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) to explore the inclusion of strata-specific PE variances
versus a single, shared PE is outlined in example 2 of the ["REMA
basics"
vignette](https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex1_basics.html).

The ADMB and TMB versions of REMA utilize different methods for
estimating variance of the total predicted biomass. Therefore, while
strata-specific estimates of predicted biomass and associated confidence
intervals will be identical between the ADMB and TMB versions of the
model, the confidence intervals of the total predicted biomass will
differ slightly. In the original ADMB code, the Marlow (1967) method is
applied, such that the total variance $\sigma_J^2$ is approximated as $$
\sigma_J^2 = ln\Bigg(\frac{\sum{e^{2 \hat{B}_j + \sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2} (e^{\sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2 - 1})}} {(\sum{e^{\hat{B}_j + \sigma_{\hat{B}_j}^2/2}})^2} + 1\Bigg).
$$ In the updated REMA library, the total variance is estimated using
the standard Delta method and can be replicated in ADMB using an
`sdreport_number` and in TMB using the `ADREPORT` macro. As described in
Monnahan et al. (2021), the exploration of methods for summing lognormal
variables is a research topic that has potential impacts beyond the
scope of REMA.

## Addition of an auxiliary catch per unit effort (CPUE) survey

In situations where an auxiliary biomass or catch per unit effort (CPUE)
survey $I_{t}$ and associated variance $\sigma_{I_{t}}$ are available,
an additional scaling parameter $q$ can be estimated to facilitate the
inclusion of this new information into biomass predictions. The
predicted annual CPUE survey index $\hat{I}_{t}$ is calculated as $$
\hat{I}_{t} = q * e^{\hat{B}_{t}}
$$ and the CPUE survey observations has an additional measurement
equation and likelihood component similar to the biomass survey: $$
ln(I_{t}) = ln(\hat{I}_{t}) + \epsilon_{I}, \text{where } \epsilon_{I} \sim N(0, \sigma_{ln(I_t)}^2), 
$$ By default, REMA estimates a single $q$ for each stratum. REMA allows
for user-specification of $q$ parameters by strata, including the option
to estimate a single, shared $q$ across all strata. If the strata
definitions are not the same for the biomass and CPUE surveys (e.g.
biomass is estimated at a finer geographic resolution that CPUE), the
user must manually define the mapping between the two surveys' strata.
However, since the the auxiliary CPUE survey index is related to
unobserved population biomass at the level of the biomass survey strata,
the REMA can only accommodate scenarios where the CPUE survey strata
have a coarser resolution or are equivalent to the biomass survey
strata.

An example with GOA shortraker is outlined in the ["Fitting to an
additional CPUE survey"
vignette](https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex2_cpue.html).

### The ADMB version of REMA

During the multi-survey development of REMA in ADMB, an error was
introduced into the likelihood component of the CPUE survey index.
Although all the equations in the ADMB template file are correctly
defined, the specification of the $ln(\hat{I}_{t})$ outside (as opposed
to inside) the likelihood component's `SEPARABLE_FUNCTION` resulted in
an incorrectly specified model and invalid model results. This error was
found while developing and testing the TMB version of the model and was
explored in more detail using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and MLE methods.
When the equation for $ln(\hat{I}_{t})$ is moved inside the
`SEPARABLE_FUNCTION`, the TMB and ADMB versions of the model produce
identical results. Additionally, when using MCMC methods in both the
"inside" and "outside" versions, we obtained identical model results
that matched the TMB and "inside" method in ADMB, providing further
evidence that placing this simple calculation outside the
`SEPARABLE_FUNCTION` resulted in erroneous results. A reproducible
example of this issue is hosted
[Github](https://github.com/JaneSullivan-NOAA/separable_function).

Currently one Tier 3 apportionment model (GOA rougheye and blackspotted
rockfish) and two Tier 5 assessments (GOA shortspine thornyhead and GOA
shortraker rockfish) use the invalid version of the ADMB REMA model.
Unfortunately, the biomass predictions from the erroneous ADMB model
exhibit significantly less inter-annual variability (i.e. lower process
error variation) than the correctly-specified REMA models. This result
is attributed to the relatively low measurement error in the biomass and
longline survey relative population weights (RPWs) fit in the model,
which causes the PE variance estimates to be higher than one might
expect for these long-lived, low productivity rockfish species. In the
next section, we describe a new method for estimating additional
observation error in REMA.

## Estimation of additional observation error

Occasions arise when the assumed observation error variance for the
biomass and/or CPUE survey is lower than may be biologically realistic
given inter-annual variability of survey estimates. These observation
errors are design-based estimates provided by the Alaska Fisheries
Science Center's Groundfish Assessment Group (GAP), and do not account
for variability in catchability of the survey gear. In these instances,
the model estimates of $(\sigma_{B_{t,j}}+\sigma_{I_{t,j}})/\sigma_{PE}$
may be lower than what should be expected based on an individual species
life history traits. For example, if the ratio of observation to PE
variation is low, model predictions of population biomass may exhibit
high inter-annual variability. This behavior would be unexpected in low
productivity species, which should exhibit low inter-annual variation in
biomass (i.e. low PE variance), especially in situations when fishing
exploitation is low.

One approach to addressing this issue is to estimate additional
observation error. This is not a novel approach; it is regularly
implemented in Alaskan crab stock assessments and has been explored in
several groundfish assessments as well. Using the biomass survey
variance as an example, the extra estimated error ($\sigma_{\tau}$) is
specified as:

$$
\sigma_{ln(B_t)}=\sqrt{ln(\frac{\sigma_{B_t}}{B_t}^2+{\sigma_{\tau}}^2+1)}.
$$ This approach is a new method for Tier 5 stock assessments and
apportionment methods at the AFSC. An example with GOA shortraker is
outlined in the ["Fitting to an additional CPUE survey"
vignette](https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex2_cpue.html),
which demonstrates that the estimation of additional observation error
for the biomass and CPUE survey observations results in a better fit by
AIC than status quo approaches and results in a more biologically
realistic trend in population biomass.

## Exploration of the Tweedie distribution for modeling observation error in cases with zero biomass observations

The Tweedie distribution is a positive and continuous distribution that
includes zero values, thus more naturally handling survey time series
with one or more zero observations. The Tweedie distribution is defined
with three parameters, a mean ($\mu$), power parameter ($\rho$), and
dispersion ($\phi$). The relationship between the variance and these
parameters is defined by $\sigma^2=\phi\mu^\rho$. In REMA, the Tweedie
is constrained using a logit-transformation on $\rho$, which bounds this
parameter between 1 and 2. Values of $\rho$ on these bounds are special
cases of the Tweedie distribution, where $\rho$=1 is equivalent to a
Poisson distribution and $\rho$=2 is a gamma distribution.

Similar to the normal distribution, observation error variances are
treated as known for the Tweedie distribution in the REMA model. Using
the biomass survey observation as an example, the dispersion of the
biomass observation in strata $j$ in year $t$ is derived as $$
\phi_{B_{t,j}}=\frac{\sigma_{B_{t,j}}^2}{{(\hat{B}_{t,j})}^\rho}.
$$

The result is that only one additional parameter ($\rho$) is estimated
when applying this alternative distribution. The measurement equation
for the Tweedie becomes $$
B_{t,j} = \hat{B}_{t,j} + \epsilon_{B}, \text{where } \epsilon_{B} \sim Tw_{\rho}(0, \phi_{B_{t,j}}).
$$ Because $\sigma_{B_{t,j}}$ is undefined when $B_{t,j}$=0, the zeros
are assumed to have a CV=1.5. This assumption can be explored by the
user in `rema`, for example, if the user wanted to define a CV=2.0 for
zeros, they would define
`zeros = list(assumption = 'tweedie', options_tweedie = list(zeros_cv = 2.0))`
within the `prepare_rema_input()` function.

An example of using the Tweedie distribution for observation error is
outlined in the ["Strategies for handling zero biomass observations"
vignette](https://janesullivan-noaa.github.io/rema/articles/ex3_zeros.html)
using BSAI other rockfish in the EBS shelf bottom trawl survey. In this
example, 13 of 38 biomass observations are zeros. While the Tweedie
performs well for this case, further exploration revealed that the
Tweedie models can be very slow to run and often did not converge,
especially in instances where the observation error variance estimates
were low. It is possible that further development on estimating
additional observation error variance (e.g. ${\tau}^2$ in the previous
section) could alleviate these convergence errors. However, in the
interim, the Tweedie distribution in REMA should be considered
experimental, and we do not recommend it as a viable alternative for
tactical assessments at this time.

## Experimental One-Step Ahead (OSA) residuals

The use of one-step ahead (OSA) residuals, also referred to as forecast
residuals or prediction errors, is crucial for validation of state-space
models like REMA (Thygesen et al. 2017). The OSA residual refers to the
forecasted value based on all previous observations. Traditional
residuals (e.g. Pearson's) are inappropriate for state-space models,
because traditional residuals will be artificially small in cases where
process error variance is overestimated (see Section 3 of Thygesen et
al. 2017 for an example). Methods for calculating OSA residuals have
been implemented in TMB through the `TMB::oneStepPredict()` function.
While these methods are relatively easy to implement in TMB, they are
computationally demanding and the validity (and accuracy) of the OSA
residuals may vary by situation and method used.

Methods to implement OSA residuals in REMA are under development and
should be considered experimental. Currently REMA implements OSA
residuals using the `method = "cdf"` option in `TMB::oneStepPredict()`,
which has the benefit of speeding up residual calculations by saving
copies of the one-step cumulative density function at each data point
and thus reducing the number of calculations at each function
evaluation. While OSA residuals appear to be calculated correctly for
some REMA models, occasionally `NaN` values for residuals are returned,
especially in cases with small measurement errors. One potential cause
of this error may lie in the initialization of the state process within
REMA and will be explored further in future versions of this package.
Finally, the algorithms underpinning `TMB::oneStepPredict()` methods are
an area of active research, and therefore this function remains in Beta
mode within the TMB package and is subject to future change.
